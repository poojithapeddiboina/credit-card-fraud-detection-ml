# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.  
Due to highly imbalanced dataset, SMOTE was applied for balancing.

## ⚙️ Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (Best Performing)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- AUC Score
- Feature Importance

## 🏆 Best Model
Random Forest performed best with highest AUC score and balanced recall.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- XGBoost
- Deploy as web app using Streamlit
